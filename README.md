### Day 6 of my 15-day SQL revision journey with MySQL! ðŸŽ‰ Even with my experience in SQL, I'm excited to revisit the basics and showcase my skills to potential recruiters. Today, I set up my environment and Filtering Data in MySQL by Joining Tables. I have selected data from tables which was created from sql-learning-day 1. This is just the beginning. Stay tuned for more SQL practice and insights over the 15 days!
### Joining tables is a fundamental aspect of SQL that allows you to combine data from multiple tables based on related columns. Here are some basic to advanced examples of joining tables using various types of joins.
#### INNER JOIN: Retrieves records with matching values in both tables.
#### LEFT JOIN: Retrieves all records from the left table and matched records from the right table.
#### RIGHT JOIN: Retrieves all records from the right table and matched records from the left table.
#### FULL JOIN: Retrieves records when there is a match in either table.
#### CROSS JOIN: Produces the Cartesian product of the two tables.
#### SELF JOIN: Joins a table with itself.
#### USING: Simplifies join conditions when columns have the same name.
#### NATURAL JOIN: Automatically joins tables by columns with the same names.
First i have inserted some data's and selected the data's.
